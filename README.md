Data Science Case Study in 2013 to Predict NFL Playoff Football Scores using Regression

I completed this case study back in 2013 to attempt to predict the scores of an National Football League (NFL) playoff game or the Superbowl using the teams regular season statistics.  Statistics were gathered from NFL.com using all regular season data from and playoff game outcomes from 2008 to 2012.

In summary, this case study was a good exercise in multivariate linear regression, however it did not produce a very useful model for predicting football scores.  It turns out that the outcome of a game of football is much more complex than the what a few statistics can provide.

The R code is provided as-is and should work when using the NFL data provided in the .csv file
